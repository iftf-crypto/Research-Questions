IFTF Crypto-Economy Working Group Research Questions
==================

1.  What do we want cryptocurrency regulation to look like in 5-10yrs, what is technologically, legally, and politically possible in that time frame, and how do we get there?

2.  How can blockchain technology be used to more effectively address public policy concerns?

3.  What types of crime do cryptocurrencies abet (anonymity, cross-border)?  What types of crime can emerging cryptoledger-based tools prevent or reduce (multi-sig, keyless trading, Proof of Solvency, etc)?  How does that move the goal posts for regulators?  How should regulation account for that?

4.  What are the emerging norms of technological and organizational self-regulation, how are they sufficient, how are they insufficient?  Eg, Proof of Solvency/Reserves, Multi-Sig Governance, Blockchain transparency, Cryptographic Key Custodianship options, etc.

5.  What categories of crypto organization are there, and should they be regulated differently?

    Examples:

    * Non-profit (Bitcoin Foundation) | For-profit (exchanges, some wallets, etc)
    * FOSS (Bitcoin) | Proprietary (3rd party services)
    * Serves customers (Online wallets, exchanges, etc) | doesn't serve customers (Non-pooled miners)
    * Custodies private keys (Coinbase) | does not custody private keys (Blockchain.info)
    * Deals in fiat (Vaurum) | doesn't deal in fiat (Blockchain.info)
    * …?

6.  How should cryptocurrency legislation and regulation converge with current money transmitter regulation?  Operate in parallel?  Should one subsume the other?  Should this area of regulation remain the purview of states, or be subsumed by federal regulation?  There are tradeoffs of each - at the state level it is onerous for startups to get 50 expensive licenses, but this enables competition among states for more crypto-aware regulation, whereas if moved to the Federal level it’s much easier to deal with but less regulatory innovation via competition.

7.  How can crypto improve financial system transparency?  Obscure it?  How should regulation account for that?  Eg, imagine the current ~$60T, opaque, "weapons of financial mass destruction" derivatives market moved to a public blockchain - suddenly the entire derivatives market becomes easily stress-testable and perfectly transparent, given enough computing power.

8.  Lawmakers and Regulators understand crime and terrorism well, but not crypto tech, hence the draconian NYDFS regs.  How do we fix that?  What do they need to know to make more informed, balanced, less draconian decisions about it? How do we get that info to them systematically?

9.  How will competition among jurisdictions, both within the US and without, to become the most crypto-aware/savvy/friendly affect the regulatory landscape?  For example, UK and Switzerland have already intimated they intend to compete to become the hub of this new 21st century financial system, starting with more favorable regulatory frameworks, so how does that affect decision-making in the US at state and federal government levels?

11.  If overly restrictive regulation happens in the US despite our best efforts, what will the outcome be?  Will it drive crypto companies and projects to other jurisdictions (states, countries), or to the black market?

12.  Is an increasingly globalized economy more congruent with “globalized” cryptoledger-based governance and fraud prevention methods than with geographically-localized regulatory regimes?

13.  What are the failure modes of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and how can/should they affect regulation?  For example, one possible failure mode of Bitcoin is the 51% or Sybil attack.  As of CoinSummit London this summer, Bitcoin miners are operating under a ‘gentlemens’ agreement’ not to exceed 40% of the mining hash rate of the network to prevent the possibility of this type of attack.  But, might regulation to the same effect might provide a stronger guarantee of network integrity than a gentleman’s agreement + economic incentives?  More generally, can law and regulation be used to compensate for algorithmic/technological deficiencies?

14.  Innovation in cryptocurrency and cryptoledger technology is happening at an extremely rapid rate.  Bitcoin's probabilistic Byzantine Consensus implementation is a "version 1.0" proof-of-concept that has opened the flood gates of research in this area - Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Activity, Proof-of-Processing, Ripple/Stellar trusted nodes, Consensus Groups, etc., plus thousands of startups, free online services, and FOSS projects.  This research and experimentation needs to be allowed to continue, not be shut down by overly restrictive regulations.

15.  How should this endeavor be organized and structured?  Sub-teams working on components of the whole with monthly sync-up meetings?  What form for deliverables?  Research reports, policy papers, full regulatory frameworks, all of the above, or something else? 

16.  How should we coordinate with Bitcoin Foundation, DATA, Chamber of Digital Commerce, and any other groups working on this topic so as to reduce replication/overlapping of effort?  The fundamental idea of this group is to research the issue on a longer 5-10yr timeframe, and provide the results of that research freely to the public as well as to the other organizations working on this.  Intent is to focus purely on generating ideas and frameworks, doing the research and due diligence on them, but leaving the actual lobbying and political advocacy to the aforementioned groups.  Will that be a suitable division of labor?
